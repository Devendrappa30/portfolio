Initiation 
"In my last project, once I received the project initiative request from my reporting manager, I reviewed the proposal to define the project goals and key deliverables. I identified the project scope, including in-scope and out-of-scope items, and established the success criteria. I conducted a stakeholder analysis to align expectations. Additionally, I developed a resource plan and submitted the required resource requests for approval. Finally, I documented all these details in the project charter to formally initiate the project."""
Planning 
"In the Planning Phase, I onboarded team members, provided a project briefing, and mapped roles and responsibilities using a RACI chart. I conducted a kickoff meeting and obtained the necessary approvals. After that, I scheduled the project and developed the budget and risk management plan. I identified key milestones, tasks, time estimates, and effort estimates using techniques and tools such as the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Critical Path Method (CPM), and team capacity planning. Additionally, I created a risk register to document identified risks and a change log to track ongoing project scope changes. To ensure effective monitoring and tracking, I developed a Gantt chart and a project roadmap."
Execution 
"During the execution phase, I track and monitor project progress using a Gantt chart for task progress, a Project Roadmap for tracking project phases, milestones, and deliverables, and I create a Risk Register, Issue Log, Dependency Log, and Change Log to manage and control project risks, issues, dependencies, and changes effectively."
Closing 
"In the Closing Phase, I ensure all project deliverables are completed and accepted. I gather and archive all project documents and obtain UAT sign-off from stakeholders, ensuring their satisfaction with the final product. I conduct a retrospective meeting to discuss what went well, challenges faced, and areas for improvement in future projects. Additionally, I manage the financial closure, which includes verifying final invoices, ensuring all payments to vendors and resources are processed, and reconciling the project budget. I also release project resources and ensure proper knowledge transfer if needed. Finally, I prepare and share the Project Closure Report, summarizing project performance, key lessons learned, and recommendations for future projects.‚Äù"
